## ABOUT

Saturn is a project management tool for remote software development teams. Anyone who has worked on a software project knows the difficulty of keeping track of feature requests and bugs. I thought of this project while being socially distanced and wanting to work on projects with other junior developers to hour our skills while we begin our job search.

## How to Use

Create an organization account and an admin account will automatically be created and associated to that organization. Go to the organization settings and retrieve the passcode that's required for any other members to join the organization. Send it to the developers you want to join the team. They can then create accounts with that passcode and be linked to the organization. As an admin, you have more functionality than the developer accounts, like adding projects, deleting stories, editing stories and making changes to the team/organization.

## Tech used

The client was developed with React, HTML, CSS
API was developed with Node.js using the Express framework as well as PostgreSQL for the database.
